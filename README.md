# mariadb-connector-net
MariaDB Connector/NET is used to connect applications developed in C#, VB.NET or any .Net framework application to MariaDB and MySQL databases. MariaDB Connector/NET is LGPL licensed.

Before DNX Core release, my major target here would be making this tool compatible with DNXCore 5 and EntityFramework.
